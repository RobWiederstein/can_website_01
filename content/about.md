# About

I’m Cathy Nestrick. After a successful career in the legal profession, I’m now “paying it forward” by helping to create more equitable and inclusive workplaces.

# My Story
After spending 30 years as a law firm partner and a vice president in the legal department of a Fortune 500 company, I began to recognize the unique obstacles facing women. I started my company’s first office of diversity and inclusion and co-founded the Parity Podcast focused on accelerating gender parity, but that wasn’t enough. Frustrated but galvanized, I knew it was time to switch gears.

# What I Do
Today, I coach women to be stronger leaders as well as men who want to be better allies for women and other underrepresented groups. I speak about inclusive workplaces, disrupting unconscious bias, and how to be a better ally.

# Clients

My clients include individuals who want to make a difference for themselves and others. I focus on the skills that matter most to my clients including how to:

- be more strategic 
- be more visible
- manage work and parenting
- understand and disrupt bias
- be a better ally
 
I also facilitate workshops and deliver talks on topics such as women in leadership, building inclusive workplaces, and how to be an ally. 

I am the co-Founder and co-Host of the Parity Podcast. You can visit the Parity Podcast webpage to learn more about my approach to women and allies.

# Education

I graduated from Hanover College with a dual major in Economics and Business Administration, and then later graduated from the Indiana University McKinney School of Law. I also earned a Certificate in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion from the University of South Florida.
